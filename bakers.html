                                <p>Melissa McCarthy is talented and funny, but did you know that she also bakes? The cakes used on the <cite>Gilmore Girls</cite> were actually her own creations! She is a stand up comedian and confectionary genius!</p>

                                <p>Janice is not only the best guitarist in the Electric Mayhem but she also has an affinity for baking, especially during the holidays. She often bakes with Cookie Monster so it will be interesting to see them compete against each other this season!</p>

                                <p>Meryl Streep may be considered one of the greatest actresses of our time. She is also one of the greatest home chefs. Did you know that all the work done on <cite>Julie Julia</cite> was filmed without any stunt doubles in the kitchen?! Watch as she gives an Oscar worthy performance in the bake off tent!</p>
