                        <p>Nick Offerman loves to bake for his wife Megan Mullaly. Most of his creations are made of wood rather than baked goods, so we thought he could use a little help in the kitchen from Muppet Labs own Beaker! Beaker is more than just a lab assistant. He actually has the recipe for fun that makes even Bunson Honeydew proud.</p>
